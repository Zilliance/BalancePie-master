			<string>My relationship with my significant other feels stagnant I need more adventure. Maybe we can book a trip to go zip-lining together. If my partner doesn‚Äôt want to do this, I can ask a friend. That way, my need gets met either way.</string>

			<string>I feel mixed about my relationship. I love the philosophical debates I have with my partner, but I dislike when they turn combative. I need to feel engaged, I need to feel like I am learning and growing, and both of those needs are being met. However, I also need to feel supported and in harmony. Sometimes, a spirited debate turns into a fight with my partner. I am going to look for new communication models so that we can keep our spirited debates friendly.</string>
